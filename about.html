      <h1>About Me.</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my first website! This is a pretty momentous milestone for me. Way back when I was in diaper-age, my very first "code" was in HTML. Remember Neopets? Yeah, that was my creative HTML outlet. I always wondered what it would be like to design my own website, and because of SENG 513, I was able to do it. Granted it's not the most flashy website ever, but I think it's an honoust first effort. And I will keep working on it, because this will always be a work-in-progress. <br><br>Like I said, I have been thinking about design since I was in diapers. I'm still thinking about design in everything I see, but I'm no longer in diapers. And being a final year computer science student, I've gotten to design plenty of things. Whether it's my Human-Computer Interactions course where I designed a restaurant interface for my favorite restaurant Moxie's, or the Network Security course where I designed actual network attacks. My education makes me feel powerful, where I have the ability to create at my fingertips. And I want to create for people. I want to understand why people act the way they do, and design solutions they didn't even know they needed. I'm excited to be graduating this June, where I hope I'll be able to employ that passion (and a <i>small</i> fraction of skills I've learned at Uni) to meaningful projects in the workforce. <br><br> I was mesmerized by some lilies I saw on my way home a week ago when Calgary had nice weather, so my website took a flower-oriented approach. Please enjoy a table of my top 5 flowers to follow.</p>
